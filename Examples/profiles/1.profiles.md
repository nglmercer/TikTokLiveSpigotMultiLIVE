# 1. What are profiles?
 
   Profile is listening for [TikTok events](https://jwdeveloper.github.io/TikTokLiveSpigot/webeditor/) and perform minecraft commands
   when event was invoked. All profiles must be under the section `profiles` in other 
   case they will not be detected

   In minecraft you can dynamically current profile with command `/tiktoklive profiles [profileName]`

   ### In this example we have 2 profiles:

   The `default` is listening for following events

   - [onJoin](https://jwdeveloper.github.io/TikTokLiveSpigot/webeditor/?event=onJoin) `Invoked when user join to live` 
   - [onGift](https://jwdeveloper.github.io/TikTokLiveSpigot/webeditor/?event=noGift) `Invoked when user send gift`
   - [onComment](https://jwdeveloper.github.io/TikTokLiveSpigot/webeditor/?event=onComment) `Invoked when user send comment to live chat`

  The `exampleProfile` is listening for event called 
   - `onEvent`  This is special kind of event that is invoked when any event was invoked

   To access event data we need to use code block `${ ....  }`.
   [Find you event](https://jwdeveloper.github.io/TikTokLiveSpigot/webeditor/)
   copy its data path and past it. For instance to get user nickname we might use `${event.user.nickName}`

``` yml
profiles:
 default:
   onJoin:
    - /say ${event.user.nickName} §7joined to §3Tik§cTok §2Live!
   onGift:
    - /say ${event.user.nickName} §7Thank you for ${event.comboCount} §2${event.gift.name}
    - /execute at @p run summon minecraft:zombie ~ ~ ~ {CustomName:"{\"text\":\"${event.user.nickName}\"}"}
   onComment:
   - /say ${event.user.nickName} -> ${event.text}
 exampleProfile:
   onEvent:
    - /say connected
```

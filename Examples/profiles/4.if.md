# 4. How to use If statement?

  If statement is very helpfully when we want to run command on some condition

  There are 3 different way of using if 
  - `Short if` `${ if [VALUE1] [OPERATOR] [VALUE2] }` when condition is negative command after this if will not be invoked
  - `If then` `${ if [VALUE1] [OPERATOR] [VALUE2] then [COMMAND] }` when condition is meet command will be invoked otherwise nothing happens
  - `If then else` `${ if [VALUE1] [OPERATOR] [VALUE2] then [COMMAND] else [ELSE COMMAND] }` when condition is meet command will be invoked otherwise else command is incoke

  Operators:
  - `is` Equal   `${if event.user.nickName is "mark" }` `${if event.count is 12 }`
  - `not` Not equals  `${if event.user.nickName not "mark" }` `${if event.count not 12 }`
  - `>` Greater   `${if event.count > 12 }`
  - `>=` Greater equals   `${if event.count >= 12 }`
  - `<` Lesser   `${if event.count < 12 }`
  - `<=` Lesser equal   `${if event.count <= 12 }`


``` yml

giftsNumber: 10
runCommand: true

profiles:
 short-if:
   onGift:
    - ${if giftsNumber > 12 } /say There are more then 12 gifts
    - ${if giftsNumber < 12 } /say There are less then 12 gifts
    - ${if runCommand is true } /say Running random command
 if-then:
    onGift:
    - ${if giftsNumber > 12 then /say There are more then 12 gifts}
 if-then-else:
    onGift:
     - ${if giftsNumber > 12 then /say There are more then 12 gifts else /say There are less then 12 gifts}
```

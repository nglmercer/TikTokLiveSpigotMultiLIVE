# 5. How to use switch?

Switch statement is very helpfully when there are few cases for our input
`${ switch [VALUE] case [CASE CONDITION] then [COMMAND] }``

When there was such a case for input data, `default` is invoked

``` yml


staticGiftName: "rose"

profiles:
 dynamicProfile:
   onGift:
    - ${ switch event.gift.name
         case "rose" then /say Thank you for rose
         case "hat" then /say Thank you for hat
         case "tiktok" then /say Thank you for tiktok
         default then /say Thank you for gift
        }
        
 staticProfile:
   onGift:
    - ${ switch staticGiftName
         case "rose" then /say Thank you for rose
         case "hat" then /say Thank you for hat
         case "tiktok" then /say Thank you for tiktok
         default then /say Thank you for gift
        }       
```

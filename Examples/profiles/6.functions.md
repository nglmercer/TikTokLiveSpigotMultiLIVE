# 6. How to use functions?

Functions are very helpful. We can use them as smaller chunks
of code with different behaviour based on input arguments

## There are few build functions

`random([min], [max])` give random number between min and max, example `random(4,10)`

`spawn([entityName])` spawn minecraft entity at player position `spawn("zombie")`

`title([title name])` display title for player `title("hello world")`

## You can also declare own functions in such a way

``` yml
sayHello: () => /say hello world

sayHelloToUser: (name) => /say hello ${name}

showViewerCount: (name, viewersCount) => if viewersCount > 1000
                                         then /say Hello ${name} there are so many Viewers!
                                         else /say Hi ${name} viewer count is not that much
           
spawnRandomMob: (mobId) => switch mobId
                            case 1 then spawn("spider")   
                            case 2 then spawn("zombie")  
                            case 3 then spawn("creeper") 
                            case default spawn("enderman")   
                      
```

## How to use function?

``` yml

profiles:
 default:
   onJoin: 
    - ${sayHello()}
    - ${sayHelloToUser(event.user.nickName)}
    - ${showViewerCount(event.user.nickName, event.totalViews)}
    - ${spawnRandomMob(random(1,4))}
```

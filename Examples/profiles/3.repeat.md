# 3. How to use Repeat?

   Sometimes there is need to run command more than once. For that purpose there is 
   `repeat [count]` keyword.
   
  `repeat` should be always placed before Minecraft command

   In `default` profile there always command be repeated 10 times when gift arrived.
   However, in `dynamicZombies` profile. `repeat` value is set to `event.comboCount` so number 
   of zombies depends on gift combo
 
``` yml

profiles:
 default:
   onGift:
    - ${repeat 10} /execute at @p run summon minecraft:zombie ~ ~ ~ {CustomName:"{\"text\":\"${event.user.nickName}\"}"}
 dynamicZombies:
    onGift:
    - ${repeat event.comboCount} /execute at @p run summon minecraft:zombie ~ ~ ~ {CustomName:"{\"text\":\"${event.user.nickName}\"}"}
```

# 1. What are profiles?
 
   Profile is listening for [TikTok events](https://jwdeveloper.github.io/TikTokLiveSpigot/webeditor/) and perform minecraft commands
   when event was invoked. All profiles should be located under folder 
   `server/plugins/TikTokSpigot/profiles`. After installing plugin you should see default 
   profile called `default.sy`

   In case you are using Visaul Studio Code,  [check out extension Yaml Script](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JWdeveloper.syml)
   it will highlight all possible events and its properties

In minecraft you can dynamically current profile with command `/tiktoklive profiles [profileName]` 



### Example profile
``` yml
onJoin:
     /say ${event.user.nickName} §7joined to §3Tik§cTok §2Live!
onGift:
     /say ${event.user.nickName} §7Thank you for ${event.comboCount} §2${event.gift.name}
     /execute at @p run summon minecraft:zombie ~ ~ ~ {CustomName:"{\"text\":\"${event.user.nickName}\"}"}
onComment:
     /say ${event.user.nickName} -> ${event.text}
onEvent: 
    /say Hi     
```   

##### Our example profile is listening for 4 events 

   - [onJoin](https://jwdeveloper.github.io/TikTokLiveSpigot/webeditor/?event=onJoin) `Invoked when user join to live` 
   - [onGift](https://jwdeveloper.github.io/TikTokLiveSpigot/webeditor/?event=noGift) `Invoked when user send gift`
   - [onComment](https://jwdeveloper.github.io/TikTokLiveSpigot/webeditor/?event=onComment) `Invoked when user send comment to live chat`
   - [onEvent](https://jwdeveloper.github.io/TikTokLiveSpigot/webeditor/?event=onEvent) `Invoked when any event was called`

   To get access to event data inside minecraft command we need to open code block `${ ....  }`.

  
   copy its data path and past it. For instance to get user nickname we might use `${event.user.nickName}`

# 5. How to use switch?

Switch statement is very helpfully when there are few cases for our input
`switch [VALUE] case [CASE CONDITION] then [COMMAND]`

When there was such a case for input data, `default` is invoked

``` yml


staticGiftName: "rose"

onGift:
   switch event.gift.name
        case "rose"
        then /say Thank you for rose
        
        case "hat"
        then /say Thank you for hat
        
        case "tiktok" 
        then /say Thank you for tiktok
        
        default 
        then /say Thank you for ${event.gift.name}

       
    switch staticGiftName
        case "rose" 
        then /say Thank you for rose
        
        case "hat" 
        then /say Thank you for hat
        
        case "tiktok" 
        then /say Thank you for tiktok
        
        default
        then /say Thank you for gift
             
```

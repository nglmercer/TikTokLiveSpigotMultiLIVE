# 2. What are variables?

   Variables are used to store data that could use later or changed
   Creating new variable is as simple as adding new yaml property
   Variables are used to store some kind of data such as:

   1. [Minecraft Commands](#minecraft-commands) 
   2. [Text](#Text) 
   3. [Numbers](#Numbers)
   4. [Logic](#Logic)
   5. [List](#List)
   6. [Function](#Function)


### Minecraft commands
Commands are detected when starts `/` symbol, and they end with the end of the current line

To use code property inside command, you need to open code block `${...}`.

You can use minecraft [color codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/minecraft-color-codes/)
by placing `&[ColorNumber]` inside command

``` yml
commandAssignedToVariable: /say &7hello world

onGift:
    commandAssignedToVariable
    /say This command is just invoked inside event
    /say This command use codeblock ${event.gift.name}
```   

### Text
  Text value must be between `"` or `'` example `userName:"Mike"` or `userName:'Mike'`

  You can use `'` inside `"` and otherwise 

``` yml
text1: "This is my text"
text2: 'my cat is brown'
text3: " I'm very excited"

onGift:
    /say ${text1}
    /say ${text2}
    /say ${text3}
```   

### Numbers

Currently only integer numbers are supported

``` yml
number1: 123
number2: 12324

#numberNotSupported: 1.23213

onGift:
    /say ${number1}
    /say ${number2}
``` 
 
### Logic
Holds value such as `true` or `false`
For this example commands `/say user join to stream!` will trigger 
only when `isEventActive` is `true` so we need to wait until first gift will be sent

``` yml
isEventActive: false

onJoin:
   if isEventActive is true
   then /say user join to stream!

onGift:
  isEventActive = true
``` 

### Lists
Stores different objects inside,
use can use `contains` keyword to check if element is inside a list

There are 2 options to get element form list,
- by using `list.get(index)`
- by using `random(list)`
``` yml
allowedGifts: ['rose', 'tiktok']
prefixs: ['thank  you!', 'you are welcome!', 'hell yeah!']

onGift:
  
  firstPrefix = prefixs.get(0)
  randomPrefix = random(prefixs)
  
  if allowedGifts contains event.gift.name
  then /say ${currentPrefix} thank you for gift 
  else /say ${currentPrefix} this gift is not alloed!
```  


### Function

Function is chunk of code with input parameters,
It's a great way to simplify your code 



In case of function that has more than one line
we should use `return`  set output value.
In example `functionWithMoreCode` we can 
see that output depends on input value

`return` can be also to just end function content 
you can see this in example `updateCounter`


``` yml

sayHelloToUser: (userName) then /say Hello ${userName} on my live!

sayHelloToUserWithColor: (userName,color) then /say ${color} Hello ${userName} on my live!

functionWithMoreCode: (value) then
  if value is 1 then
   return /say command for value 1
  else 
   return /say command for different value

giftCounter: 0  
  
updateCounter: () then
   giftCounter = giftCounter + 1 
   giftCounter = giftCounter * 2
   return   

onGift:
    sayHelloToUser(event.user.nickName)

    sayHelloToUser(event.user.nickName,"&1")
    sayHelloToUser(event.user.nickName,"&2")
    
    functionWithMoreCode(0)
    functionWithMoreCode(1)
    updateCounter()
```

# 4. How to use If statement?

  If statement is very helpfully when we want to execute command on some condition

  There are 2 different way of using if 
  - `If then` `if [VALUE1] [OPERATOR] [VALUE2] then [COMMAND] ` when condition is meet command will be invoked otherwise nothing happens
  - `If then else` `if [VALUE1] [OPERATOR] [VALUE2] then [COMMAND] else [ELSE COMMAND]` when condition is meet command will be invoked otherwise `else` command is invoked

  Operators:
  - `is` Equal   `if event.user.nickName is "mark"` `if event.count is 12`
  - `not` Not equals  `if event.user.nickName not "mark"` `if event.count not 12`
  - `>` Greater   `if event.count > 12 `
  - `>=` Greater equals   `if event.count >= 12 `
  - `<` Lesser   `if event.count < 12 `
  - `<=` Lesser equal   `if event.count <= 12`
  - `contains` use for text or lists to see if they contains an element


``` yml

giftsNumber: 10
runCommand: true
blockedUsers: ["mike", "adam", "john"]
randomText: "my dog is green" 

onGift:
    
    if runCommand is true
    then  /say Running random command
    
    if giftsNumber > 12 
    then /say There are more then 12 gifts
    
    if giftsNumber is 12
    then  /say There is 12 gifts
    
    if giftsNumber > 12
    then /say There are more then 12 gifts
    else /say There are less then 12 gifts
    
    
    if event.gift.name is "rose" 
    then /say thanks for rose!
    
    if event.gift.diamondCount is 100
    then /say thanks for expensive gift!
    
    if blockedUsers contains "mike" 
    then /say you are blocked!
    else /say hello!
    
    if randomText contains "dog" 
    then /say this text contains a dog inside!
```

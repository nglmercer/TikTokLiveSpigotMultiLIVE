# 3. What is  Repeat?

   Sometimes there is need to run command more than once. For that purpose there is 
   `repeat [count]` keyword.
   
  `repeat` should be always placed before Minecraft command

   For this example every each gift there will be spawned 10 zombies, however
   count of pigs depends on gift comboCount, so it could be one on hundred

### Example
``` yml

onGift:
  repeat 10 /execute at @p run summon minecraft:zombie ~ ~ ~
  repeat event.comboCount /execute at @p run summon minecraft:pig  ~ ~ ~
```

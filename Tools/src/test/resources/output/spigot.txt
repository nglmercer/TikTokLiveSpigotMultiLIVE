A Java library based on TikTokLive and TikTokLiveSharp. Use it to receive live stream events such as comments and gifts in realtime from TikTok LIVE by connecting to TikTok's internal WebCast push service. The package includes a wrapper that connects to the WebCast service using just the username (uniqueId). This allows you to connect to your own live chat as well as the live chat of other streamers. No credentials are required. Besides Chat Comments, other events such as Members Joining, Gifts, Subscriptions, Viewers, Follows, Shares, Questions, Likes and Battles can be tracked. You can also send automatic messages into the chat by providing your Session ID.[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwdeveloper/TikTokLiveSpigot/master/webeditor/resources/banner.jpg[/IMG]

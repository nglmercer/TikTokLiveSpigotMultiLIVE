# 3. How to make conditional: command If statement
#    Sometimes we need to trigger command only when some condition is meet
#    To do it use ${if [value1] [operator(==, >, >=, <, <=)] [value2]}. For this example we are checking if nickname of
#    user that send like is Mark. If it's not then command is ignored
#
#  example-profile:
#   onLike:
#       - ${if event.user.nickName == "mark"} /say ${event.user.nickName} thank you for like!
#   onGiftMessage:
#       - ${if event.gift.diamondCost == 10} /say ${event.user.nickName} Thank you for gift!
#       - ${if event.gift.diamondCost == 100} /say ${event.user.nickName} Thank you for nice gift!
#       - ${if event.gift.diamondCost > 1000} /say ${event.user.nickName} That gift is so expensive!
#
# 4. How to repeat command: Repeat statement
#    If case you want to repeat command X times use ${repeat [counter]}
#
#  example-profile:
#   onLike:
#       - ${repeat 10} /say ${event.user.nickName} thank you for like!
#   onGiftMessage:
#       - ${if event.gift.name == "rose"} ${repeat 5}  /say  Thank you for ${event.user.nickName} rose!
#       - ${if event.gift.name == "cow"} ${repeat 10}  /say  muuuuuuuuuu
